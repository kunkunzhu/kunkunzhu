### Hello!

My name is Kun (she/her), a '25 BMath student at the University of Waterloo who is passionate about the intersection between **tech** 👩🏻‍💻 and **empathy** 💛. In particular, I am eager to learn more about the building of meaningful digital experiences and user-centered design, where the technical ideas converges with artistic expressions to create something wonderful! 💌
